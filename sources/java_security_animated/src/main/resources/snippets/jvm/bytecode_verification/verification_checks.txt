In particular it performs checks such as:
   - each loaded classfile has the correct format;
   - access restrictions are not violated

   - local variables are used correctly within the method scope;
   - final classes are not subclassed;
   - final methods are not overriden;
   - every class has a single superclass;
   - there are no illegal data conversions;
   - methods are called with proper number and type of arguments;
   - methods return correct types;
   - there are no operand stack overflows on underflows.
