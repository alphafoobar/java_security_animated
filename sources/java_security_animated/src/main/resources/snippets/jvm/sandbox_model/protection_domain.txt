The protection domain for each loaded class is set by 
the classloader(s) of the application. It encapsulates 
the code source (location of where the class is loaded 
such as an HTTP URL or a location on the local file system),
the set of permissions that apply for the target class and 
the set of principals that correspond to a logged in user 
and to which the target class is accessible. To get the 
protection domain for a class you can invoke the 
getProtectionDomain() 
method on the class instance.
