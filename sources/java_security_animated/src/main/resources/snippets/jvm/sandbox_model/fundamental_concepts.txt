The two main APIs that are used to enforce the 
Java security sandbox model are java.lang.SecurityManager and
java.security.AccessController. The later is a newer API and 
the default java.lang.SecurityManager operations delegate to the 
java.security.AccessController API methods which are static and can
be called directly without having to create an instance of 
access controller. A java.lang.SecurityManager instance on the 
other hand needs to be installed in the JVM either:
	- programaically by calling System.setSecurityManager()
	typically at the startup of the application;
	- by setting the java.security.manager parameter.
By default a security manager is not installed.
