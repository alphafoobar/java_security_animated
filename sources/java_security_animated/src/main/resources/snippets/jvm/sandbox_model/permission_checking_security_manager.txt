In many places the JDK does permission checking in order
to check that the currently executing code has the 
permission to call a certain API in case a 
security manage is installed. This is also done 
extensively by managed environments like JavaEE
in order to grant proper access to deployed applications.
During permission checking the security.policy file
is consulted in order to determine the set of 
permissions for the currently executing source code.
