For example if we want to check if we can create or accept
connections to github.com on ports between 8000 and 9000 
we might do the following:
SocketPermission permission = 
	new SocketPermission(“github.com:8000-9000","connect,accept");
SecurityManager sm = System.getSecurityManager();
if (sm != null) sm.checkPermission(permission);
We first check if a security manager is installed and if that is the 
case we invoke the checkPermission() method that traverses the 
current call stack and checks if all classes in the stack have 
the target permission. 
If that is not the case a security exception is thrown.
