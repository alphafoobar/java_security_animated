The sandbox model also provides the possibility 
to escalate privileges of the currently executing code,
to switch the current user for the current execution context
or to combine both using the following methods:
java.security.AccessController.doPriveleged()
javax.security.auth.Subject.doAs()
javax.security.auth.Subject.doAsPriveleged()
During privilege escalation only the part of the 
current call stack starting from the point of 
calling doPriveleged() is a point for permissions checking.
