Permissions are defined in a security.policy file which by default 
resides in the JDK installation and defines a simple DSL for 
the definition of permissions. A simple policy entry that allows
all classes of a JAR file to delete files from the C:\\Windows 
directory is the following:
grant codeBase file://some_file_path/lib.jar {
    permission java.io.FilePermisions “C:\\Windows” “delete”
}
