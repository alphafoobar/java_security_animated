The Java security sandbox model has been created to 
address the issue of loading and executing untrusted code 
such as Java applets on a client environment such as 
the user's browser. Over the years this model was applied 
successfully to provide access control capabilities to 
different managed environments like JavaEE and OSGi or 
even in other environments like Oracle RDBMS to provide 
access control for Java stored procedures executed by the 
RDBMS. Latest JDK release still depend entirely on this 
security model which was shaped as early as JDK 1.2
