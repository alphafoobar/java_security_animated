There are two rules which apply for security policy files:
	- one permission can imply another
	(e.g. permission java.io.FilePermisions “C:\\Windows” “delete”
	implies 
	permission java.io.FilePermisions “C:\\Windows\system32” “delete”
	 - one code source my imply another code source for which a set of
	 permissions apply
	 (e.g. "C:\\projects\libs" implies "C:\\projects\libs\\third-party")
