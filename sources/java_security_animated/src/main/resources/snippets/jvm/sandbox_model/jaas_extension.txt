As of JDK 1.4 the Java Authenication and Authorization Service
(JAAS) extends the sandbox model and the syntax of security.policy
file with the possibilty to specify permissions based on attributes
(principals) of the currently authenticated user. For example:
grant principal javax.security.auth.x500.X500Principal "cn=Tom" 
{ 
    permission java.io.FilePermissions “C:\\Windows” “delete” 
} 
If a user has been authenticated against an X500 server and has a 
'cn' attribute with value 'Tom' he gets the permission to delete
the C:\\Windows folder. Refer to the JAAS section for 
further information.
