JDK versions after 1.5 release introduce various 
improvements and extensions on the API of the 
security sandbox model but the core architecture remains 
the same. Example of this improvements include LDAP support
for JAAS and new methods in the java.security.AccessController
class that provide the possibility to check only against a 
certain subset of permissions.
