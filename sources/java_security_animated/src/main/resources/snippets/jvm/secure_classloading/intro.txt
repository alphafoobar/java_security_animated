A classloader is an instance of the java.lang.ClassLoader class.
There might be custom classloaders defined that load certain components 
of the application (i.e. managed environment like JavaEE or OSGi define such)
or a JDK's built-in implementation (such as java.net.URLClassLoader) that loads 
the classes, JAR files or other resources from the application's
CLASSPATH or MODULEPATH (as of JDK 1.9).
The java.net.URLClassLoader extends the java.security.SecureClassLoader 
(introduced as of JDK 1.2) that leverages the access control 
mechanism introduced by the Java sandbox model to further secure the process 
of classloading.
