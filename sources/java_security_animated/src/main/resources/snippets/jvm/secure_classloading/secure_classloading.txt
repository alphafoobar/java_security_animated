The java.security.SecureClassLoader has a twofold purpose:
   	- to provide a possibility to set the protection domain 
   (an instance of java.security.ProtectionDomain) for the 
   loaded classes. The secure classloader sets the code source
   (location of where the class was loaded from) 
   and the set of permissions 
   (determined statically or dynamically)
   as defined over the code source in the security policy file 
   (see section about Sandbox Model);
   	- to provide access control checks that 
   	classloading is allowed by the executing code.
