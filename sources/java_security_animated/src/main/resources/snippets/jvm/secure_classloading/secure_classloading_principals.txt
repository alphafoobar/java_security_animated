An additional point to make is that the protection domain 
of loaded classes may also be amended with a set of principals 
representing a JAAS subject but the secure classloader sets them to null
during classloading (as its subclasses should do).
The set of principals might be set during execution after the JAAS subject 
corresponding to those principals has been successfully authenticated by 
the application. It is the security policy file that determines the 
access control based on a combination of the code source, set of principals 
and signers of the code (refer to the section on Sandbox model and JAAS).
