On a much smaller scale exploits of the type system are possible
due to JVM bugs, in particular in the bytecode verifier which 
are dramatically reduced in latest JVM releases. Or there might 
be trusted APIs (i.e. sun.misc.Unsafe) try provide mechanisms
to bypass (and exploit) the Java type system. Some sources 
refer to this type of attacks as type confusion.
