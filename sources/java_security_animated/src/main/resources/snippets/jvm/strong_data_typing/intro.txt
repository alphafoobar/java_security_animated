The type system defined in the Java programming language 
is considered strongly types based on two pillars:
   - variable types must be specified explicitly. 
   In that regard the Java compiler and bytecode verified
   can enforce some checks for type compatibility.
   - in case the previous cannot be deducted statically it is
   the JVM that enforces type checking based on set of rules
In that regard exploits trying to call operations on different 
objects (trying to make use of weaker constraints) 
are not possible.
