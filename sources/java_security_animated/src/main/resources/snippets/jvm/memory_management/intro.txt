Automatic memory management in Java not only provides means
for more efficiency but also enhanced security.
It reduces dramatically the possibility of conducting exploits 
that make use of unhandled memory to inject malicious code
which is the case for example with buffer overflow attacks
(possible on a large scale in other languages like C++).
