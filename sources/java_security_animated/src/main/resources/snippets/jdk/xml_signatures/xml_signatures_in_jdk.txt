The XML digital signature API introduced in JDK 6 
provides an implementation of the standard for Java.
Signing and verification are in a way similar to 
JAR signing and verification in a way that signature informaion 
is embedded withing the signed XML document (as it is with signed
JAR files). The process of generating a XML signature
using the API is as follows:
    - an instance of javax.xml.crypto.disg.XMLSignatureFactory 
    is used to create reference to the document or block to be signed
    and a signing info used during the signing process;
    - digital certificate is retrieved and wrapped in a 
    javax.xml.crypto.dsig.keyinfo.KeyInfo object;
    - the document to be signed is parsed and signed 
    using the created signing info and key info.
