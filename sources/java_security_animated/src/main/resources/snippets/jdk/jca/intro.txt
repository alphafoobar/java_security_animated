The Java Cryptography architecture has a pluggable architecture
that allows different providers (either built in the JDK or 
third-party) to provide different implementations of 
cryptographic algorithms. JCA provides utilities for:
    - creating digital signatures;
    - creating message digests;
    - using cryptographic ciphers (symetric/asymetric, block/stream);
    - using different other types of cryptographic services 
    and algorithms.
