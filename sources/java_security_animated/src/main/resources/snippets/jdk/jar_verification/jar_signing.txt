JAR signing provides a 
mechanism for securing JAR files using digital signatures. 
In order to sign the lib.jar file with a private key corresponding 
to the 'cert' alias you may use the jarsigner utility as follows:
jarsigner lib.jar cert
The above command will use the default .keystore file 
located in the user's home directory in order to 
retrieve the private key corresponding to the alias
and will also override the lib.jar with a signed version of it.
In order to specify a different name for the signed JAR you
can use the -signedjar option.
