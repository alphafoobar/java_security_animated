    an authenticated user
    - java.security.Principal - a concrete representation
    or characteristic of the authenticated subject
    (i.e. an e-mail address, a username or an LDAP entry reference)
    - javax.security.auth.spi.LoginModule - 
    interface used to supply different login mechanisms. 
    - javax.security.auth.login.LoginContext - 
    the entry point to the JAAS system providing the ability to 
    create objects used for authentication
