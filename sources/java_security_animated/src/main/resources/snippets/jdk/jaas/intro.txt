The Java Authentication and Authorization service 
release with JDK 1.4 provides a mechanism to 
programmatically authenticate users in Java applications 
and assign them privileges. As mentioned in the 
Security Sandbox section it is the JAAS authorization
feature that extends the syntax of the security.policy
file with the possibility to assign permissions to 
the principals of a JAAS subject being authenticated.
The authentication part provides a pluggable 
authentication module (PAM) framework.
