Before parties can start exchanging messages 
in a secure manner TLS handshake must be established. 
It is required in order to negotiate the type of 
information they are going to use in order to 
establish the secure communication channel.
A handshake can be triggered in several ways such as
trying to read/write to a TLS socket, trying to get 
the current TLS session from the socket or explicitly
calling the startHandshake() method on the socket.
