The TLS/SSL series of protocols are used to secure most types 
of network communication and also provide means for the creation of
SSL VPN connections. 
JSSE provides an implementation of the TSL/SSL series of protocols. 
It provides two models of operation:
    - blocking - implemented by means of TLS/SSL sockets
    and works in a similar manner as standard Java sockets;
    - non-blocking mode of operations - much more complex 
    to use.
Up to JDK 9 TLS 1.0, 1.1 and 1.2 are supported via the JSSE API.
TLS 1.3 is supported as of JDK 11.
